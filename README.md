# Analysis into the EU 2022 Day-Ahead wholesale power market

Electricity in the EU is traded both on the exchange and over-the-counter (OTC) each with different time horizons. Trading takes place on the futures, day-ahead (DA) and intraday markets. On the futures market, companies agree on deliveries up to six year in advance named 'futures' on the exchange and 'forwards' in OTC trading. On the other hand, the spot market consists of solely DA and intraday markets with auctions taking place either daily or multiple times a day. The market clearing price falls (_almost_ exactly) on the intersection of the aggregated supply and demand curves, with most markets being 'pay-as-cleared' meaning all bids and offers below the market clearing price will be paid the same amount. This analysis will focus on potential revenue from various EU wholesale DA markets over the course of 2022.
